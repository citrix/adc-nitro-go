		* If the expression itself includes double quotation marks, you must escape the quotations by using the \ character.
		* Alternatively, you can use single quotation marks to enclose the rule, in which case you will not have to escape the double quotation marks.

A longer string can be split into smaller strings of up to 255 characters each, and the smaller strings concatenated with the + operator. For example, you can create a 500-character string as follows: '"<string of 255 characters>" + "<string of 245 characters>"'

		To prevent delays for low-priority requests across multiple priority levels, you can configure weighted queuing for serving requests. The default weights for the priorities
		are:
		* Gold - Priority 1 - Weight 3
		* Silver - Priority 2 - Weight 2
		* Bronze - Priority 3 - Weight 1
		Specify the weights as 0 through 101. A weight of 0 indicates that the particular priority level should be served only when there are no requests in any of the priority queues.
		A weight of 101 specifies a weight of infinity. This means that this priority level is served irrespective of the number of clients waiting in other priority queues.
